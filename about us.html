<!-- Why -->
<div class="container my-5">
    <h2 class="section-title">Why We Do This</h2>
    
    <div class="personal-story p-4 rounded" style="background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #5da4a6;">
        <p class="mb-0">
            As someone who has walked through the shadows of bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety, 
            I understand firsthand how isolating and overwhelming mental health struggles can be. 
            There were days when getting out of bed felt impossible, and moments when the world seemed 
            too loud yet too silent at the same time.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mt-3 mb-0">
            But I also learned something crucial: <strong>understanding transforms suffering</strong>. 
            When I began to learn about my conditions and when I could name what I was experiencing—the 
            stigma lost its power, and healing became possible. That's why we built Gentle Minds: 
            to create a bridge between clinical knowledge and human experience, so no one has to 
            navigate their mental health journey feeling alone or misunderstood.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mt-3 mb-0">
            Your struggle does not define you, but understanding it can empower you. 
            We're here to provide that understanding with compassion, without judgment, 
            and with the unwavering belief that everyone deserves mental wellness.
        </p>
